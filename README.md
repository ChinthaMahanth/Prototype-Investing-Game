This project explores various investing strategies and key aspects of personal finance through research and practical analysis.
We studied investment approaches such as buy-and-hold, dollar-cost averaging, value and growth investing, dividend strategies, and risk management.
Using Python, along with tools like yfinance and web scraping, we backtested these strategies to observe their historical performance and understand their effectiveness in different market conditions.
Based on these insights, we translated our findings into a simple text-based quiz game that allows users to engage with core concepts, develop a foundational sense of the stock market, and practice decision-making in a simulated environment.
It is important to note that this game remains a prototype and does not encompass the full scope of investing knowledge; it is intended as an educational introduction rather than a comprehensive financial tool.
